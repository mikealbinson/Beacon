# RFID
###This is the rough beginning of a RFID driver that could run an RC522 RFID reader over the Edison’s SPI interface. Please note: **this has not been implemented nor am I planning on implementing it at the moment** although it would be a very cool feature to add in the future and increase the beacon’s flexibility.

##RFID.js
The base SPI bindings for the RFID reader. Based on [this library](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid) that was originally written for Arduino.

##RFID_Example.js
An example of a possible RFID implementation—not currently functioning, likely due to some issues in the RFID bindings
