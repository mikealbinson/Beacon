# RFID
###This is the rough beginning of a RFID driver that could run an RC522 RFID reader over the Edison’s SPI interface

##RFID.js
The base SPI bindings for the RFID reader. Based on [this library](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid) that was originally written for Arduino.

##RFID_Example.js
An example of a possible RFID implementation—not currently functioning, likely due to some issues in the RFID bindings
